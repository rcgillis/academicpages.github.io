Session description:
This session will provide an overview of the latest versions of the Public Knowledge Projectâ€™s free, open source Open Journal Systems (OJS 3.0) and Open Monograph Press (OMP 1.2) publication management software, used by over 400 library-hosted journals across Canada, and close to 9,000 around the world. It will include an examination of the submission process, peer review and editorial workflow, XML transformation, web site management, as well as a discussion of the latest software features and free service options provided by the Public Knowledge Project (including indexing, DOI management, LOCKSS preservation, and continuing education). This workshop is aimed at librarians, editors, IT managers, and others interested in learning more about this open source alternative for academia controlled publishing. Participants will come away with the ability to start up and operate their own online journal or monograph publication management system. Bring your laptop if you'd like to follow along. A demonstration URL will be provided.
